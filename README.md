# X.com_clone
# 👋 Hi, I'm Saumya Kushwaha

I'm a Computer Science student at Rama University and a detail-driven front-end developer passionate about crafting responsive and user-centric web interfaces. I thrive on solving layout quirks, optimizing design flow, and building clean UI clones that feel intuitive and modern.
## 📌 About This Repository

A responsive front-end clone of X.com (formerly Twitter) built using **Tailwind CSS**, structured with semantic HTML, and deployed via **Vercel**.  
Inspired by modern UI patterns to replicate a familiar social feed experience — from sidebars to tweet cards!
